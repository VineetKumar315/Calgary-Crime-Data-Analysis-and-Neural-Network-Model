# Calgary-Crime-Data-Analysis-and-Neural-Network-Model
## The aim of this project is to use the Crime and Disorder Data provided by the City of
Calgary's data website to analyze the data and predict the number of crimes that will
occur in the future. The data is from 2018 to 2024 and contains the number of crimes
that occurred in Calgary for each month. After throughly analyzing the data, I will be
building a neural network model and optimizing it to predict the number of crimes that
will occur in the future.
